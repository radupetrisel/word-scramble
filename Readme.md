# WorldScramble

This is project 5 of 100 days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson (link [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/word-scramble-introduction)). This project is a game that will show players a random eight-letter word, and ask them to make words out of it. For example, if the starter word is “alarming” they might spell “alarm”, “ring”, “main”, and so on. 

As usual, there will be challenges at the end of the guided tutorial part of the project for me to solve on my own, and I will add separate commits for each challenge as I complete them.

**Challenge 1**: Disallow answers that are shorter than three letters or are just our start word.

**Challenge 2**: Add a toolbar button that calls startGame(), so users can restart with a new word whenever they want to.

**Challenge 3**: Put a text view somewhere so you can track and show the player’s score for a given root word. How you calculate score is down to you, but something involving number of words and their letter count would be reasonable.
